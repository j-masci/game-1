A little project I did to teach myself some python code as well as learn some things about 2d simulation.

Move the rectangle with arrow keys and awsd. Space to shoot little circle thing that bounce off walls and explode after some time.

Built with pygame.

To run:

```commandline
pip install pygame
pip install pygame_gui
python start.py
```
